@section benchmark_eigen Benchmark results

Benchmarking programs were generated by 'make' under bench/ directory. 

Graphs on this page show how mlcpp compares to <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org">Eigen</a> (version 2.0.15) - mlcpp runs no slower than Eigen in all tests except for one case. Mlcpp performs significantly better than Eigen in indexing, matrix partitioning and matrix-matrix multiplication.

Test environment was Ubuntu 10.10 x86_64 with Xeon 3.73 GHz CPU and 4G memory. Both mlcpp (dynamically linked to MKL) and Eigen were compiled by g++ 4.4.5 with "-DNDEBUG -O3 -msse2".

In the graphs, N is the rank of square matrices and y-axis is running time (lower number is better).
