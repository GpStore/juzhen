Prerequisite
  You need Intel MKL. 

How to use
  1. Run unit tests first and make sure it passes everything:
     cd mklpp_source_dir
     make 
     
  2. #include <mklpp.hpp> in your source file and add '-Imklpp_source_dir' 
     to your compile flags 

Problems and improvements
  Please report issues through github:
  https://github.com/huichen/mklpp/issues
  I don't have time to write all new features you want but I'm very glad to merge 
  them into my branch.
