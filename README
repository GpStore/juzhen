Prerequisite
  You need BLAS and LAPACK packages. 

How to use
  1. Set MLCPP_BLASLIB envron as the library you have, such as
     export MLCPP_BLASLIB=mkl
     export MLCPP_BLASLIB=atlas

  1. Run unit tests first and make sure it passes everything:
     cd mlcpp_source_dir
     make (or make -f makefile.mkl for MKL) 
     
  2. #include <mlcpp.hpp> in your source file and add '-Imlcpp_source_dir' 
     to your compile flags 

Problems and improvements
  Please report issues through github:

  I don't have time to write all new features you want but I'm very glad to merge 
  them into my branch.
