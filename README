Prerequisite
  You need a package that provides CBLAS functions, such as MKL. 

How to use
  1. Set MLCPP_BLASLIB envron to mkl if you want to use MKL 
     export MLCPP_BLASLIB=mkl

  1. Run unit tests first and make sure it passes everything:
     cd mlcpp_source_dir
     make 
     
  2. #include <mlcpp.hpp> in your source file 
     and add '-Imlcpp_source_dir' to your compile flags. 
     Use '-DUSE_MKL' if you use MKL 

Notes
  1. Following functions only compiles with MKL
     matrix::eigen, matrix::leigen, matrix::reigen 

  2. matrix::getDataPtr() provides column-major raw array pointer of a matrix 
     to use in unwrapped BLAS/LAPACK functions 

Problems and improvements
  Please report issues through github:

  I don't have time to write all new features you want but I'm very glad to merge 
  them into my branch.
