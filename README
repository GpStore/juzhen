Prerequisite
  You need a package that provides CBLAS functions, such as MKL. 

How to use
  1. Set MLCPP_BLASLIB envron to mkl if you want to use MKL 
     export MLCPP_BLASLIB=mkl

  1. Run unit tests first and make sure it passes everything:
     cd mlcpp_source_dir
     make (or make -f makefile.mkl for MKL) 
     
  2. #include <mlcpp.hpp> in your source file 
     and add '-Imlcpp_source_dir' to your compile flags. 
     Use '-DUSE_MKL' if you want to use MKL  

Problems and improvements
  Please report issues through github:

  I don't have time to write all new features you want but I'm very glad to merge 
  them into my branch.
